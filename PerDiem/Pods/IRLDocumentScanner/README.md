## Installation

The recommended approach for installing IRLDocumentScanner is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation. For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods **>= 0.19.1** using Git **>= 1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

### via CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your Podfile and add RestKit:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '8.0'
pod 'IRLDocumentScanner', '~> 0.1.2'
```

### Manually

- [Download IRLDocumentScanner](../../archive/master.zip)
- Copy to your project those 2 files: <strong> IRLCamera.storyboard | IRLCameraMedia.xcassets </strong>
- Copy to your project this folder: <strong> Source </strong>
- Make sure your project link to  <strong>  'Foundation', 'UIKit', 'AVFoundation', 'CoreImage',  'GLKit' </strong>




## Getting Started

IRLDocumentScanner is designed to be a standalone drop in dependency. You instanciate the controller, defining its delegate and present it.


## Examples

### Objective-C

```  objective-c
#pragma mark - User Actions

- (IBAction)scan:(id)sender {
    IRLScannerViewController *scanner = [IRLScannerViewController standardCameraViewWithDelegate:self];
        scanner.showCountrols = YES;
        scanner.showAutoFocusWhiteRectangle = YES;
        [self presentViewController:scanner animated:YES completion:nil];
}

#pragma mark - IRLScannerViewControllerDelegate

-(void)pageSnapped:(UIImage *)page_image from:(UIViewController *)controller {
    [controller dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{
        [self.scannedImage setImage:page_image];
    }];
}
```

### Swift

``` Swift
   // MARK: User Actions

    @IBAction func scan(sender: AnyObject) {
        let scanner = IRLScannerViewController.standardCameraViewWithDelegate(self)
        scanner.showCountrols = true
        scanner.showAutoFocusWhiteRectangle = true
        presentViewController(scanner, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
    
    // MARK: IRLScannerViewControllerDelegate
    
    func pageSnapped(page_image: UIImage!, from controller: IRLScannerViewController!) {
        controller.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true) { () -> Void in
            self.imageView.image = page_image
        }
    }
```
